## Project Overview

The aim of the project is to design and develop a game that can be used to
treat [Amblyopia](http://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/amblyopia.htm),
or more commonly known as *'Lazy Eye'*, in children aged 4-12 years.    

The game must be exciting and interactive so the child engages for the
specified period of treatment time. The child should focus on the gaming
that they enjoy and not feel that they are in a particular treatment period.    

## This Document

This document serves as a top level README for the project. It will be updated
throughout the semester to include information about the structure and
purpose of the project.

### Repository Structure

At the top level, the repository is divided into three sections:

  * *docs/* Project documentation
  * *project-code/* Deployable project files
  * *ui-temaplates/* User interface (frontend) templates

### IDE

The main project is built using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

### Documentation Structure

All documentation should be stored in the *'docs/'* directory, so it is well
separated from project code. The following subdirectories
have been added to the documentation directory to start:

  * *meeting-minutes/*
  * *planning/*
  * *reports/*
  * *research/*

Additional subdirectories should be made in the relevant directory as needed. Subdirectories
should be named in lowercase with a *'-'* to represent a space character, for example
*'new-subdirectory'*.

To avoid later problems regarding documentation (such as being worked on in
different branches my multiple people resulting in a merge conflict), all
documentation should ideally only be on the main branch (development).
Anyone working on the same documentation should organise their commits/pushes
between themselves to mitigate errors.

### Running Star Glider

These instuctions detail how to run the application on your machine...
